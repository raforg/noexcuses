noexcuses - runs cronjobs until they succeed

DESCRIPTION
~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometimes cronjobs fail to run successfully because a required server (like
a database or FTP server) is temporarily unavailable due to power failures,
hardware failures, software failures, network outages, choice of operating
system, pilot error, and the like.

Typically, this results in someone being forced to examine crontabs and error
reports, determine which cronjobs really need to be run, and then run them
manually. This happened to me twice in one week. I don't want it to happen
again. Cronjobs are meant to be automated and I want them to stay that way.

This is the rationale for noexcuses. It keeps track of cronjobs that have
failed and keeps running them until they succeed. All you have to do is look
at your crontabs, identify the cronjobs-that-must-succeed-no-matter-what and
insert noexcuses before the command.

Then, when cron runs noexcuses, noexcuses will run the given cronjob. If the
cronjob fails, noexcuses becomes a daemon that will retry the cronjob
regularly until it succeeds. Even if the cron host is rebooted before the
cronjob succeeds, noexcuses lets you restart all of the outstanding
cronjobs. Even if the cron host is down for a while, noexcuses can tell you
which cronjobs missed out on running while it was down and run them. The
initscript noexcuses.init can make this happen automatically at boot time.

In other words, noexcuses is a free, lightweight, fine-grained, unobtrusive,
high-availability tool for cronjobs. Or rather, it's a high-recoverability
tool for cronjobs which can either be incorporated into a highly available
system or used in the absence of one.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Noexcuses is written in Perl5 and should run on any UNIX-like system where
cron runs. Perl v5.6.0 or higher is recommended for improved security. There
is no need to install any additional non-standard perl modules. Support for
Vixie cron syntax extensions is almost but not entirely complete.
