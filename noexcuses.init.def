# /etc/default/noexcuses.init - Configuration for noexcuses(1) init script

# Override the location of the noexcuses command
# e.g. noexcuses=/usr/local/bin/noexcuses

# Default time period to scan looking for missing jobs: #d#m#h#s
#period=1h

# Forget outstanding jobs that were relocated to another cron host (i.e. -f)
# This requires the mirror to be defined and mounted (or nothing happens).
# Warning: If the file server takes longer to boot up than the cron host,
# then the mirror directory will probably not be mounted! If that happens,
# then this will not work and jobs that have been relocated to another
# cron host may incorrectly be restarted on this host. [might be dangerous!]
#relocated=no

# Restart known jobs on boot? (i.e. -x all) [might be dangerous!]
#restart=no

# Recover missing jobs on boot? (i.e. -R) [might be dangerous!]
#recover=no
