INSTALL
=======
Noexcuses is written in Perl and should run on any UNIX-like system where
cron runs. The optional initscript requires SVR4-style initscripts. There
are no dependencies on any non-standard Perl modules. Support for Vixie cron
syntax extensions is almost but not entirely complete.

To install noexcuses and its manpage (under /usr/local by default):

    tar xzf noexcuses-1.0.tar.gz
    cd noexcuses-1.0
    make install

To install under /usr:

    make PREFIX=/usr install

To uninstall noexcuses and its manpage (from under /usr/local):

    make uninstall

To uninstall noexcuses and its manpage (from under /usr):

    make PREFIX=/usr uninstall

To install the optional initscript (only with SVR4-style initscripts):

    make PREFIX=/usr install-init

To uninstall the initscript:

    make PREFIX=/usr uninstall-init

Note that noexcuses can be installed under /usr/local (the default) or under
/usr but the SVR4-style initscript must be installed with PREFIX=/usr or it
won't be installed into /etc/init.d which is where it needs to be in order
to work.

For more details:

    make help

The manpage for noexcuses is noexcuses(1).
